question 1:
It was a simple brute force, the only observation was that if a character is not an alphabet or a digit ,it would be a special character.

question 2:
The brute force solution would yield a O(n^2) solution,so it had to be O(nlogn) approach.
using the inbuilt search funtion which works in logn time when,calculated the minimum number
in the potions  after which all of the potions can be selected to make a successful pair,thus iterating over all n values of spell yielded
a nlogn solution.
